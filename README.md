# Proposed Project

### I am addressing the issue of domestic violence. Domestic Violence is informally defined as any incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive, threatening behavior, violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are, or have been, intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality. I chose this issue because many people arenâ€™t educated on what counts as domestic violence and in fact many each state approaches domestic abuse differently. 

### I wanted to create an application that allows us to understand the importance of addressing such issues and educates people more on how prevalent domestic violence is and hopefully provide this sense of urgency that our states and our country needs to do better addressing complaints, and issues of domestic violence cases.
