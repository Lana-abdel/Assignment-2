# Coding Guidelines: 

### Community members can also submit solutions to bugs and issues or make improvements. They can implement the solution on a fork of the main proect and then create a merge request when their work is complete. They should include proper documentation and specify exactly what was changed. 
### 
1. Make code self documenting
2. Include comments where necessary and to add clarity
3. Conduct extensive testing of addition 
4. Include readme file to document changes made  
5. Write commits that are discriptive of the changes you made
6. Create issues after first checking the issues/bugs on the github. If you see that your issue is not on the list please add it in, if it does you can start working on that issue and submit a pull-request when you are done.  
7. All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).

### It is important to note that we not all pull-requests, or bug fixes may be approved. The code that is accepted will be the one that is well-documented and meets the coding guidelines specificied above. It may also depend on prioritization of issues to be merged etc.
